## An introduction to ReasonML

---

# About Me
--

Hi, my name is **Sophia Brandt**. 👋

--


I work as a **tax officer**. 🏢  

I do exciting things like **auditing tax returns**.


--

In my spare time, I learned coding. 💻

--

I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

--

And then I learned **React.js**.


---

## This talk will be about JavaScript, React, and ReasonML from a **beginner's perspective**.

---

# Agenda
--

* The Problem with JavaScript & React.js 👎
--

* Alternatives? 🛣
--

* ReasonML, And Why? 🤔
--

* Show Me Some Code ⌨
--

* Don't Use ReasonML 🚫
--

* Why I **Like** ReasonML ❤️
--

* Some Thoughts About TypeScript ⌨
--

* ReasonML - yay or nay? 📝

For example,
--

* TypeScript?
--

* PureScript?

--
* Elm?

--
* Reason?

## All valid, choices, but let's focus on:

# Reason, and Why?

---
* React as first intended
--

* ReasonML is **OCaml** under the hood, but with a familiar syntax
--

* solid type system: **100%** coverage from the get-go
--

* excellent type inference
--

* fast compiler
--

* **immutable** by default
--

* _practical_: you _can_ do side-effects, and mutations
--

* it nicely maps over React's syntax
--

* work with JavaScript ecosystem: build tools, package management

---

# Demo

---

# Don't Use ReasonML
--

* **steep learning curve**
  * if you only know dynamically typed languages
  * it's _not_ JavaScript
--

* small community & ecosystem
  * but they are very friendly!
  * you might need to write bindings to libraries yourself
--

* bad documentation
  * Reason docs, BuckleScript docs, ReasonReact docs???
  * it will get better
  * [reasonml.org][reasonmlorg]

---

# Why I like ReasonML

```reasonml
type option('a) = None | Some('a)
```
--

* no more `undefined`
* a wrapper around a value that _maybe_ exists
---

```reasonml
let licenseNumber =
  if (personHasACar) {
    Some(5);
  } else {
    None;
  };
```

Later:
```reasonml

switch (licenseNumber) {
| None => print_endline("The person doesn't have a car")
| Some(number) =>
  print_endline("The license number is " ++ string_of_int(number))
};

```
---

* `variant` types: make impossible states ... impossible

--

```reasonml

type payload =
  | BadResult(int)
  | GoodResult(string)
  | NoResult;
```
--
* **pattern-matching**

```reasonml
let data = GoodResult("Product shipped!");

let message =
  switch (data) {
  | GoodResult(theMessage) => "Success! " ++ theMessage
  | BadResult(errorCode) => "Error! Error code: " ++
    string_of_int(errorCode)
  };
```
---
## Some Thoughts About TypeScript
(as a beginner)

--
* it's a bit easier to learn _at first_
--

* bigger reach (StackOverflow, etc.)
--

* `<any>` type
--

* type inference doesn't work that well
--

* code is verbose & hard to read

---

## ReasonML - yay or nay?

ReasonML is an **functional, immutable, type-safe** alternative to vanilla React.js.

ReasonML is **fun**.

You **have to learn a new way of thinking**.
